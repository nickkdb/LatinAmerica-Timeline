The crisis came to its peak when workers decided to riot, which led to the President's resignation.",significance:"This was a display of power by the common people, showing they will no longer be subject to unjust and bias legislation and government decisions.

Over the two year span of the War, many brutal battles between the Aztecs and Spaniards took place. The Aztecs suffered massive loses from famine and the smallpox epidemic, which weakened their defense enough for the Spanish to take control. On August 13th 1521, the Aztec forces were destroyed, and leading to their surrender to the Spanish.",significance:"The Aztec Empire being conquered was the first domino to fall in the Spanish colonization of the New World. This started the era of Spanish domination over the Americas and their native peoples, as well as the 300 year rule of Mexico by Spain."},{key:"1532",image:O,heading:"Spanish Conquest ot the Incan Empire",date:"1532-1572",location:"Incan Empire, modern day Peru",background:"The Incan is one of the most storied, and largest Empire in the pre-colonization era of the Americas. After a power struggle for control of the empire led to a half-decade Civil War, the Incan Empire suffered heavy casualty. In the midst of the Civil War, the Spanish arrived to a weakened Empire, who easily were defeated by the stronger Army. The Incan attempted to recapture control of their Empire many times, with the the of the Incan rebellions taking place 40 years later, in 1572.",significance:"This marked the end of a legendary Empire, along with a significant obstacle for Spanish colonization removed. The Incan Empire was the largest Empire in South America, and with control came an easier route to domination over South America."},{key:"1494",image:h,heading:"The Treaty of Tordesillas",date:"June 7th, 1494",location:"Tordesillas, Spain",background:"After desputes between the Spanish and Portugese between claims to lands of the New World, the nations agreed to this Treaty, which set the a vertical line that divided Western South America into Spanish territory and the Eastern side of the Continent to Portugal.

This settlement became known as Santo Domingo, and was regarded as the 'Gateway to the Caribbean'.",significance:"The discovery of Hispanola and the initial settlement made the Spanish was arguably the biggest stepping stone in the Spanish Colonizaiton of the Caribbean Islands.

De La Casas made the argument that all people were required to be treated justly and Spain had the responsibility to uphold that.",significance:"De La Cases spent over half his life attempting to gain rights for the Indians, and is one of the earliest human rights advocates known to man. Through writings, debates, and attempted swaying of the Monarchy, De La Casas did more for the Indians than possibly any other Spaniards. This event was significant, as it may be De La Casas strongest efforts for human dignity at the time.

Juan Evo Morales Ayma was from the Aymara tribe, born to farmers in a small village. Morales won with a stunning 54% of votes, the first majority in Bolivia in nearly three decades.",significance:"This was a critical win for Indigenous rights and the Indigenous of Bolivia. Latin America as a whole has continued to struggle with Indigenous discrimination and hatred, and this was true during the election of Morales as well. Morales winning brings hope for a new era of government, where Indigenous peoples' votes and voices matter, and government isn't restrictive based on class or ethnic origins."},{key:"2000",image:C,heading:"Cochabamba Water Wars consume Bolivia",date:"November 1999 - April 2000",location:"Cochabamba Bolivia, South America",background:"In 1999, the Bolivian government began the privatization of many business in the nation, including water supplies across the country.

The company taking over the water supply in Cochabamba hiked the price to around $20 a month, and threatened to shut down water of those who didn't pay. This led to massive riots and protest by the people, and tens of thousands of civilizans racksacked the city and fought police. This ended with a reversion of the new water policy, and the deposing of Bolivia's president.",significance:"This event's significance shows the people's willingness to uprise in a modern day setting.

Thus the Portugese founded this Colony, which is near the border and Buenos Aires. This allowed them to control the competition from this area, allowing Portugal more success.",significance:"This was a significant event in the history of Latin America, as the competition between Spain and Portugal at this time set the basis for the impending Spanish-Portugese War.

Within 10 days, the slave army had taken over the entire Northern Province of the colony.",significance:"This was a significant uprising, as it was the first group of people to make a major revolutionary attempt, starting the revolutionary wave. Where as America was a nation of free men revolting against their colonizers, Haiti was one of the early examples of a group of marginalized or enslaved people being the ones to rise up against their enslavers."},{key:"1789",image:p,heading:"Storming of the Bastille (French Revolution)",date:"July 14th, 1789",location:"Paris, France",background:"The French Revolution was a 10 year process that culminated in 1789.

The governments failure to handle this led to much distress in the communities, and led to an uprising against the government. The Storming of the Bastille was the turning point of the revolution, and it's date is independence day in france to this day.",significance:"Though this occured in Europe and was not directly related to Latin America, its significance in the region was immense. The French and Thirteen Colonies' uprisings set the tone for the Revolutionary wave that followed in the next century."},{key:"1804",image:w,heading:"Hispanola officially becomes the first Indpendent state in the Latin Americas",date:"January 1st, 1804",location:"Saint Dominigue, Hispanola",background:"After an uprising which started in 1791, Dessalines (leader of the free Haititans) officially declared Haiti a free republic.

In fear of Europeans returning to the Caribbean and interfering, the U.S. declared that we would act as the protectors of the Caribbean.",significance:"This Doctrine is significant because it began an era of the United States mingling in Latin America countries' orders.

The CIA helped carry out a covert Coup, and reinstalled a military dictatorship.",significance:"This is a significant step in Latin American history, as it marks the beginning of the U.S.'s mid 20th century coups against Latin American leaders in favor of hand picked candidates by the U.S. This continued with dangerous precedent, and in many cases the countries we left behind became war ridden and suffered massive setbacks by U.S. intervention. This is a different type of invasion than was seen in previous centuries, but the damage the U.S. caused these nations by destroying their governments and leaving nothing better behind is still prominent today."},{key:"1959",image:A,heading:"Cuban Revolution's Triumph",date:"1959",location:"Cuba",background:"The Cuban revolution saw the overthrowing of Dictator Batista's government by Fidel Castro's revolutionaries.

This is one of the scariest, most notable of the U.S. attempted coups in Latin America.

After the U.S. put Augusto in power and left the region, Augusto killed thousand of people who opposed him during the coup. Decades later, Augusto was arrested in England for the human rights violations he committed as leader of Chile.",significance:"One of the most horrifying interventions by the U.S. is our intervention in Chile. After ensuring Augusto's revolution was successful, the U.S. essentially abandoned the region. Augusto was an evil leader who committed many atrocities using the power that the United States gave him.
